# Jupyter and conda for R


See great blog post from Christine Doig [here](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r).
Basically, you have to install Anaconda for Python 3 first (see [Anaconda](anaconda.md)).
After downloading Anaconda, you can use `conda` to install as following.

```bash
conda install -c r r-essentials
```

Simply run `jupyter notebook` and create new `R` notebook.
